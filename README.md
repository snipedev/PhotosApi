This Api facilitates reading from flickr API

## Requirement
The APi is currently configured for reading FLickr Apis, However the same API canbe leveraged to use other photo storages likes of Amazon S3, google Photos Api, Pinterest...

### Assumptions:
This API has a provided user API key for reading the Flickr API. A correct practice should be to use Azure Vault but the key is being read from environment settings for development purposes
The Api only facilitates single Tag search feature which in this case suffices the business requirement
